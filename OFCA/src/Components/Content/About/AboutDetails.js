        heading:'How Does The Online Fitness Coach Academy Work?',
        content:"When you enter the Online Fitness Coach Academy, you’ll have a daily personal development video to watch on fitness nutrition, exercise, or other health topics. You’ll watch the video, and then you’ll read the key takeaways that I’ve written up on the subject. Though you’re not required to, I strongly recommend typing up your own brief summary/takeaways of the video as well for improved learning. This will also allow you to create a database of write-ups on topics that clients will inevitably ask you about throughout their journeys; the Online Fitness Coach Academy will give you a scientifically-backed answer to many, if not all, of their questions. Videos are generally under 10 minutes in length, so the time commitment is super manageable on a daily basis."

        heading:'How Long Is The Program?',
        content:"The way it’s designed is that each level of the Academy is a 3-month self-paced course with three checkpoints. Because it’s self-paced, though, you could theoretically do the program as quickly as you want. To complete one level of the Academy in 3 months, it only requires about 10 minutes per day, plus the time it takes you to write up your own takeaways.For many who take on the Online Fitness Coach Academy, because of the level of passion you have for fitness, you’ll be so eager to finish that you’ll likely finish significantly more quickly than 3 months."

        heading:'Online Fitness Coach Academy Assessments',
        content:"At each checkpoint, you will have an assessment based on the information you’ve learned over the previous month (or however long it took you to complete the unit). You must score at least 70% on each assessment to move on to the next phase of the 3-month certification program. There are three total assessments – you must score at least 70% on all three assessments to obtain your OFCA certification.Unlike many certifications, there is no “retake” fee. So you can keep re-testing until you pass if for any reason you don’t pass on the first attempt."

        heading:'Applying What You Learn To Your Training And Your Business',
        content:"Though it’s not required, I highly recommend that students go through one of my Lyon Shred programs simultaneously with the Online Fitness Coach Academy. This way you can directly try out/experiment with the things you’re learning in the Academy AND you can see how I’ve crafted a customized program for clients (in this case, you) that can be used without an instructor there in person.This way you’re expanding your knowledge of fitness/nutrition/exercise/health AND you’re learning the business side of how it all comes together as an online program."

        heading:'Scaling Your Impact',
        content:"The knowledge you’ll gain throughout the Academy will allow you to take your own fitness/nutrition/training to the next level. The information is presented in a way that is immediately implementable, allowing you to make actionable changes to progress further in your own fitness journey.If you’re interested in coaching others, because the certification is for online coaching specifically, this pursuit will enable you to scale your impact beyond the clients you could potentially meet with in-person. As you go through the Online Fitness Coach Academy coursework, you’ll amass a repository of videos, knowledge, and written takeaways that you can share with clients to help them through their own journeys with you as their coach. Even the most dedicated in-person personal trainer can only train 40-60 clients, and they’re trading time for money. As an online coach, you have the ability to reach and impact 100s, if not 1000s, of clients."

        heading:'What Happens After I’ve Finished The Academy?',
        content:"Once you’ve finished the 3-month certification program and received at least 70% on all three assessments, you’ll be an OFCA certified online coach, meaning you’ll be a certified OFCA Level 1 Online Fitness Coach. So in your Instagram bio, resume, website, marketing posts, etc. you can write “Your Name, OFCA”. But far more powerful than the credential is the knowledge you’ll have at your disposal. This knowledge has allowed me to create six separate customizable program offerings for my clients, which has allowed me to work with over 500 clients across a diverse age and gender demographic, in 15 countries on 6 continents. If that sounds like something you’re interested in, then the Online Fitness Coach Academy is for you."

        heading:'What If I Want To Take My Knowledge Beyond Level 1?',
        content:"After you’ve completed Level 1 and have received your official OFCA certification, you may advance to Level 2 of the Online Fitness Coach Academy. Level 2 is structured in the same way as Level 1 but will expand your base of knowledge even further than Level 1 learnings. Upon completion of the Online Fitness Coach Academy: Level 2, you’ll be an OFCA2 certified online coach. There are five levels of the Academy, with the OFCA5 being the most advanced and comprehensive. Each level of the Academy directly feeds off the knowledge gained in the previous levels.You may sign up for as many levels of the Academy as you’re ready to commit to in advance, but you can only begin Level 2 after completing Level 1. I highly recommend signing up for as many levels as you’re able to as a commitment to your own personal development, as a commitment to your business, and as a commitment to the success of your clients."
